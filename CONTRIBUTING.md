Contributing
============

Here's a quick list of tips for contributing to this project:

1. Please try to follow the same style (indentation, spacing, general look of the code) as what already exists in the project.
2. You should make sure your editor uses [EditorConfig] so you can follow our whitespace rules easily. This is optional, but a convenient way to configure your editor to match our style.
3. Make sure `npm run check` reports no warnings nor errors.

Thanks for helping out!
